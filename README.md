Hi, Tim here!
I'm a Frontend (Web) Developer.


🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a self-taught Web (Frontend) Developer (& a bit of Designer) with humanistic and social background, in search of a peaceful, intentional, and unstressed life, who likes to learn new things, self-improve, read, watch docuseries, do sports, travel and meet unique people. Two things I cannot live without are chill music and the feeling of not being stuck. One of the mottos I try to remind myself daily is, “When a monkey loses a banana to a rival, he feels bad, but he doesn’t expand the problem by thinking about it over and over. He looks for another banana. Be like a monkey.”
